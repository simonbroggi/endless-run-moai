endless runer implementation for the MOAI game engine
================

All folders in the lua directorie should contain the following files:

runner.png : a 4 times 4 sprite sheet. the first 12 images being a walk cycle, the bottom 4 a jump animation.

runnerSound.ogg : a sound beeing looped while the animation is playing

point.png : whatever the character wants to collect

portal.png : the entrance into your world ;)

At the start of the game a folder will be chosen at random, and that runner is loaded.
If you collect 10 points a portal will appear and bring you to another world.
